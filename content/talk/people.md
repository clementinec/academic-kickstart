We are not AIR.
-------------------------
Conventional HVAC system designs uses air temperature as the only indicator of thermal comfort states - so long as the temperatures sits within a range, it is safe to assume that person is comfortable - at least that's what the current standards are telling us. 

We are individual humans that are _different_.
-------------------------
Needless to say, the differences between the occupants are somewhat striking: between men and women, and between occupants of different build, age and weight, the heat-producing mechanism alone would result in a wide range of metabolic rates, let alone the differences caused by different muscle/fat ratios, etc. 

This talk was [selected ](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/05/07/princeton-research-day-explores-research-process-across-disciplines) to be among the five Princeton Research Day (PRD) Talks on May 7th, 2019.
