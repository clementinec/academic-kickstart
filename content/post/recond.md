A brief history of delivering thermal comfort
-------------------------
We understand the built environment as a whole where its very existence chanllenges the well-being of all of us at the get-go of mankind: we had to fight for our own livelihood, and manages to stay as warm as possible to avoid the frigidness quietly steals away our lives in our dreams. Our ancestors managed to do things the smart ways, by first finding shelter, next finding means to reshape the thermal environment of shelters, i.e. setting up fires, etc., and repeated those steps once we entered into the modern society. The shelters we live in now are no longer shelters, we live in them, eat in them, bathe and sleeps in them and expect them to provide the best possible comfort possible. And that, for many less-than-moderate climates, means the cooling demands need to also be satisfied. And fast forward to approximately 1920s, the first commercially available HVAC unit made it possible for us to stay within the shelters - now buildings - as long as possible, and ideally as comfortable as possible.

Except it wasn't an easy task at all.

# This section, called 'Front Matter', is what tells Hugo about the content in this file: the `title` of the item, the
# `description`, and the `date` it was posted. In our example, we've added two custom bits of data too. The `categories` and
# `tags` sections are used in this example for indexing/grouping content. You will learn more about what that means by
# examining the code in this example and through reading the Hugo [documentation](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction).
