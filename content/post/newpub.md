Mean radiant temperature review and air vs. MRT is up!
-------------------------
Super excited to see that the review of mean radiant temperature that I authored is to be published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews! Worked on this particular review for a really long period of time - and hopefully it would provide an in-depth review into the concept, its shortcomings and limitations as much as its benefits in the design of building systems. The current understanding of mean radiant temperature assumes many things: that it is almost equivalent to the measurement of globe thermometers - and is therefore singlular to an indoor space, and can sometimes even be approximated by air temperatures. Many of these assumptions may have been true for air-conditioned rooms with temperate environments outside. However, for environments that have radiant asymmetry due to the choice of building system (radiant systems such as radiant floors or chilled beams) and geometries (large glass fa√ßade) will likely result in gross over/underestimate of the system performance. 

Also accepted - and now in proof stage is the air temperature and mean radiant temperature paper, focusing on a particular curious relationship between the two most important means of heat transfer for occupants indoors: convection and radiation. Within the scope of comparing different system configurations and building geometries, simulation of air temperature is much more difficult to manage than mean radiant temperature. Meanwhile, within a given environment, mean radiant temperature is much more difficult to measure than air temperature. Their relationship works both ways and is increasingly difficult to envision without a study that compares the spatial and temporal variation of the two physical propoerties. 

Increasing complaints or increasing challenges?
-------------------------
Up until very recently, the hard-earned capability of cooling the indoor environment is both held dearly by occupants of less temperate climates, and criticized by others - more particularly the _office occupants_ within the open plan office environments. A particularly damning piece from the NYTimes, which triggered many subsequent reports, suggested that the key difference of women not feeling thermally comfortable within an indoor office environment is the metabolic rate assumed (58$$W/m^2$$) was derived from men. While many news outlets tried to cover the story from their own perspectives, the fundamental problem that the occupants are omitted in designing the current HVAC systems, remains unsolved.
